Hi, I'm Marcelo Segala, a graduate with a Bachelor's and, recently, Master's degree in Chemical Engineering. Currently under preparation for a PhD in computer science.

Some of my projects are shared in this Github profile. You may find math instead of programming projects, but I hope you enjoy reading.
